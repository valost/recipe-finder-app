## RECIPE FINDER APP ##

This is a Next.js search app built with TypeScript that allows users to find recipes based on user-defined filters, including cuisine type and preparation time. The app provides a list of matching recipes, and users can click on a card to view detailed information about a recipe, including ingredients and preparation time.

Note: to be able to navigate to the list of recipes a user must type a dish name or use at least one filter.
